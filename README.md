# Nose-sorter
Building AI course project

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

When sorting hazardous waste, wastestation workers often face challenges in identifying packaging left by customers. Employees has to do huge job sometimes to identify the contents of packaging.
Artificial intelligence saves workers time and guarantees occupational safety.

## Background

I myself work in the waste industry and often hear how challenging this is. I think that artificial intelligence could be used to solve this and save staff hours when artificial intelligence could identify the contents of packaging.


This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* Occupational safety risk
* Identification difficult


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Man](https://images.app.goo.gl/65dk9iJFc1TZTnFS8)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://images.app.goo.gl/65dk9iJFc1TZTnFS8" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?

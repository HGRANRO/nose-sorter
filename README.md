Building AI course project

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

When sorting hazardous waste, wastestation workers often face challenges in identifying packaging left by customers. Employees has to do huge job sometimes to identify the contents of packaging.
Artificial intelligence saves workers time and guarantees occupational safety.

## Background

I myself work in the waste industry and often hear how challenging this is. I think that artificial intelligence could be used to solve this and save staff hours when artificial intelligence could identify the contents of packaging.


This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* Occupational safety risk
* Identification difficult
